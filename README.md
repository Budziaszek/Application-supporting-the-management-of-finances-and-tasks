# Description
The project was created as part of an engineering thesis. It was decided to create a tool that allows you to use efficiently time and manage household budget. 
The app will help users manage their tasks and overseeing the time it takes to complete them, and thus ensure improving their implementation. 
App allows you to monitor expenses through displaying the available amount of money, adding new transactions as well as sharing
their history. The collected data are presented in the form of graphs and statistics facilitate their analysis.
Bearing in mind that most of the responsibilities and funds are usually shared between group of people (e.g family members)
